# osc-demo
OSC (or Open Sound Control) is an open standard for low latency, realtime messaging. It was designed to be a successor to MIDI, but is not limited to audio equipment. There are lots of pre-existing OSC libraries and interfaces, so it's a great candidate for controlling VR experiences.

This demo shows how to get OSC data into your Unity scene, and parse it for use in your app.
